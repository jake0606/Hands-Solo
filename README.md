<b>Hands Solo</b>

Single player arcade style game built in HTML Canvas. Originally conceived during GameJam 2018 when built for OpenFrameworks in C++. Canvas version updates some UX issues and integrates with the App42 API for high scores.

Some code a bit clunky and requires streamlining (which might happen one day... maybe)


<i>App42 keys removed for obvious reasons. Add your own to enable highscore features.</i>
